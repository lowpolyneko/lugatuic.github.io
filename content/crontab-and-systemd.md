# Crontab Introduction

### Crontab Basics

-   Super simple to set up
-   Reliable (unlike some operating systems [^1])
-   Allows you to consistently run tasks
    -   Get status updates via email (or not)

[^1]: Looking at you, `taskschd.msc`

### Cronjob Examples

We call tasks that run on the crontab "cronjobs"

Layout: `minute hour dom month dow task [arguments]`

- `*/1 * * * * /home/jacob/notification-checker.py`
    - Run a script to check if we need to send a notification every
    minute.
- `0 2 * * mon /root/pull-remote-backups.sh`
    - Runs every Monday at 2:00 a.m., pulling my server backups
- `@reboot echo 'Message Text' | mail -s 'Server Rebooted!' email_address@domain.tld`
    - Send yourself an email every time your machine reboots

### Editing the Crontab

>How do I edit the Crontab?

Run this command, that's all: `crontab -e`

To change your editor, you can run `select-editor`, or just change your `$EDITOR` environment variable.

### Configuring Emails

If you already have emailing setup on your Linux server (or home
computer!), you can simply write, somewhere in your crontab

> `MAILTO=email_address@domain.tld`

# Systemd Introduction

What is `systemd`? `systemd` is an array of software tools for many
different Linux\
operating systems.

Its main goal is to serve as a "system and service manager" across Linux
distributions.

The crontab actually runs on top of systemd on many systems!

### Systemd Services

> According to a helpful `man systemd.service` command, a systemd service
> is a "process controlled and supervised by systemd".

Below is a `systemd` service I have for a Rust Discord bot I wrote.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Rust Discord Bot
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
EnvironmentFile=/root/Rust-Discord-Bot-Env
ExecStart=/sbin/rust-discord-bot

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Working with Systemd Services

To configure a service to start on boot, we must first add it (as a
`.service` file) to the systemd system directory (usually
`/etc/systemd/system/`).

Then, we use the `systemctl` command to configure the service (`sudo`
here only necessary our service is a *system* service).

```ini
sudo systemctl enable service-name.service # Makes the service start on boot

sudo systemctl start service-name.service # Starts the service now (so no reboot)

sudo systemctl status service-name.service # Checks the current status of the service

journalctl -u service-name.service # Shows service logs
```

### Systemd User Services?

You can also have systemd services run on your *user accounts* (no
`root` needed)!

This is just as simple as the system services, with three differences to
keep in mind:

1.  You place the service file in `~/.config/systemd/user/` instead of
    `/etc/systemd/system/`

2.  You add a `--user` flag to all `systemctl` commands

3.  Your service can't start on boot anymore, now, since it must start
    within the context of *your* user account.
