LUG stands for [Linux User's Group]{.underline}. We are a pre-professional
organization who's mission is to provide a community space for like-minded
individuals with interests in:

-   Linux
-   Free and Open Source Software

-   Privacy and Security
-   *among others\...*

## Fun Facts
-   We are one of the oldest student organizations in the University,
    next to **ACM**, our sister organization.

    ![Our website has been active since
    2006!](/static/gbm/site_history.png){width="60%"}

-   We share an office with ACM in [SELE 2264]{.underline} where
    *anyone* can come in and talk technology!
-   We maintain one of the largest CS org Discord servers, nearing
    **500** members :D

# What's Linux?
**Linux** is a free and open-source operating system kernel. Linux
is part of a family of operating systems that bundle various pieces of
software to form a complete OS, called [Linux distros]{.underline}.

![Tux, the Linux mascot](/static/gbm/tux.svg){width="90%"}

## Why Linux?

-   It's truly free!
    -   Anyone can view, modify, and redistribute the the kernel and its
        underlying source code.
    -   It's actually libre/available for no charge.[^1]
-   Linux powers millions of devices like Android smartphones,
    Chromebooks, and even the **top 500** supercomputers in the world!
-   Unix-like systems like Linux are widespread in academia. Learning
    its usage is beneficial to your research and coursework!
-   Linux systems are tailored to software development, programming and
    installing dependencies is far easier on Linux than other operating
    systems.
-   It's [not]{.underline} Windows.
    -   Or macOS either\...

Curious? Check out our Linux Week event coming soon![^2]

# What We've Been Up To
## Past Presentations
In the past, we've ran presentations/workshops on
various topics to spread knowledge of how to better use a Linux system.
Some of these include:

-   Vim, the ubiquitous text editor
-   SystemD, the system and service manager
-   Makefiles
-   GDB
-   *and more\...*

You may have even encountered these in your coursework!

## Website
![LUG Website](/static/gbm/website.png){width="\\textwidth"}

We've been building a *community-contributed* knowledge-base for
Linux users at UIC who\...

-   [daily-drive]{.underline} Linux
-   use Linux in a class (i.e. `systems{1..4}.cs.uic.edu`)
-   need information about Linux, GNU, Free Software, etc. or are
    otherwise trying to learn

Our new website has been in active development since **2022**. Students
are also free to contribute, our website is open source under the MIT
license. Check it out! <https://lug.cs.uic.edu>

## Projects
We've been working on fun things within the ACM/LUG room,
mostly hobbyist projects that *anyone* can get involved with!

</figure>

Apart from that, our GitHub has many of our open-source works,
including:

-   Cerberus, an LDAP user management app
-   `eventfetch`, automated event flyers
-   `doorkeeper-driver`, an evdev driver for keycard readers
-   `doorbot`, a Discord bot to keep access in the ACM/LUG office

Among many other incomplete works lost in the weeds due to time. Check
it out here: <https://github.com/lugatuic>.

## Server Rack
![ACM/LUG Server Room](/static/gbm/server-rack.jpg){width="90%"}

We share a server rack with **ACM**. We own our own server on the
rack: `miku`. `miku` is a Dell Poweredge R610 running Proxmox, a
KVM-based hypervisor which manages virtual machines. This server has an
overkill amount of hardware.

# Future Plans
## Tentative Semester Presentations
We're proud to offer these topics as
workshops this semester.

-   Linux, Libreboot, and Thinkpads
-   Intermediate Tmux Usage
-   Homelabbing

*If you want a specific topic covered or want to present your own
presentation, let us know!
[`lug-officers@uic.edu`](mailto:lug-officers@uic.edu)*

## Linux Week
Linux Week is our (somewhat) annual event where we teach
introductory Linux skills to newbies.

Linux Week 2024 is being held [within the next two
weeks!]{.underline}[^3]

Topics include:

-   Installing Linux on Your Machine
-   Coreutils and Filesystem Usage
-   Package Management
-   Shell Scripting and Pipelines
-   Software Freedoms and Copyleft

Keep tabs on our Discord and the newsletter listserv for further
announcements.

## Cyberforce
![image](/static/gbm/cyberforce.png){width="90%"}

This year, LUG members are representing UIC in the Department of
Energy's Cyberforce competition! Cyberforce is a
[cybersecurity]{.underline} competition where members:

-   solve CTFs
-   harden infrastructure against *actual* White Hat hackers
-   identify and re-secure breached machines

The event is [in-person]{.underline} in St Charles, IL nearby Fermilab
and is a fun way to get hands on experience with system security against
**real professionals**.

## The Endless To-Do List
We have some projects we'd like to get done, and
we need help! If any of these interest you, feel free to reach out to
us.[^4]

-   Re-image `chopin`, a legacy server on the ACM/LUG server rack.
-   Spin-up a Matrix homeserver and [bridge]{.underline} it with the
    Discord.
-   Migrate our website off Github Pages and onto our own server.
-   Add features to our website like a sidebar and search.
